# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

There are 13 features variables and one target variable in the dataset used.
They are:- age,sex,cp,trestbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal,target

We are going to take the following approach:
1. Problem Defination
2. Data
3. Evatuation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

Data Exploration (exploratory data analysis or EDA)

The goal here is to find out more about data and become a subject matter export on the dataset you're working on.

1. What question(s) are you trying to solve?
2. What kind of missing data do you have and how do we treat different types?
3. What's missing form the data and how do you deal with it?
4. Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
5. How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?
